# 🚗 Car Price Predictor using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Car Price Prediction** project!  
This machine learning model predicts the selling price of a used car based on key features like brand, mileage, fuel type, engine capacity, and more. It uses a regression model and is deployed via a user-friendly Streamlit web app.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Used car pricing can be tricky — sellers often overprice, buyers lowball. This app helps estimate a car's fair price using machine learning, trained on a structured dataset.
